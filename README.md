# hello-world
This is my first repository to learn how to use github

So when creating a new repository with the option "Initialize this repository with a README"
a readme.md-file is created which has the repository's name as abolded headline as line #1 and the description as line #2

I would like to add my opinion. hm this guide has a style of showing just the steps how to create a new repository but does NOT give an overview how GitHub works at the beginning. let's see if this comes later....
