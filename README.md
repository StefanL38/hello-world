# hello-world
This is my first repository to learn how to use github

So when creating a new repository with the option "Initialize this repository with a README"
a readme.md-file is created which has the repository's name as abolded headline as line #1 and the description as line #2

I would like to add my opinion. hm this guide has a style of showing just the steps how to create a new repository but does NOT give an overview how GitHub works at the beginning. let's see if this comes later.... 

So this is the "readme-edits"-branch of master where I add some typing in the readme.md-file (this line etc.)
What I will make a "pull-request" about this whole Github is that the # NAME of the branch is shown !!! everywhere

Ok the branches name "readme-edits" is shown at the bottom. Guys this should be shown at the top
and as you know every browser can open many browser-tabs. The each GitHUB-site should quote   all the details about which repository, branch and everything else about where exactly in which sub-sub-sub-branch-fork-pull-request this page is located.
